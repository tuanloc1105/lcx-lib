# Note

When build this proto module. You may install the `protoc` cli at [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). When I wrote this note, the current newest version is [`30.0`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/30.0).

After that install the `protoc-gen-grpc-java` plugin at [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/grpc/protoc-gen-grpc-java/). When I wrote this note, the newest version is [`1.71.0`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/grpc/protoc-gen-grpc-java/1.71.0/protoc-gen-grpc-java-1.71.0-linux-x86_64.exe)

When finished download the plugin, rename the file name to `protoc-gen-grpc-java` and add it into executable path. And remember to add executable permission for the files
